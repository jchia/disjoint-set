Persistent Disjoint-Sets (a.k.a. Union-Find).  This implements
disjoint-sets according to the description given in
\"/Introduction to Algorithms/\" by Cormen et al
(<http://mitpress.mit.edu/algorithms>).
Most functions incur an additional O(logn) overhead due to the use
of persistent maps.

Disjoint-sets are a set of elements with equivalence relations defined
between elements, i.e. two elements may be members of the same equivalence
set. Each element has a set representative. The implementation works by
maintaining a map from an element to its parent. When an element is its
own parent, it is the set representative. Two elements are part of the
same equivalence set when their set representatives are the same.

In order to find the set representative efficiently, after each traversal
from an element to its representative, we compress the path so that
each element on the path points directly to the set representative.  For
this to be persistent, lookup is stateful and so returns the result
of the lookup and a new disjoint set.

Additionally, to make sure that path lengths grow logarithmically, we
maintain the rank of a set. This is a logarithmic upper bound on the
number of elements in each set. When we compute the union of two sets,
we make the set with the smaller rank a child of the set with the larger
rank. When two sets have equal rank, the first set is a child of the second
and the rank of the second is increased by 1.

Below \alpha(n) refers to the extremely slowly growing inverse Ackermann
function.

Given two instances of disjoint sets that share no members in common,

This method is unsafe in that is does not verify that the two input
sets share no members in common and in the event that a member
overlaps, the resulting set may have incorrect equivalence relations.

Create an equivalence relation between x and y.

This function works by looking up the set representatives
for both x and y.  If they are the same, it does nothing.
Then it looks up the rank for both representatives and
makes the tree of the smaller ranked representative a
child of the tree of the larger ranked representative.
If both representatives have the same rank, x is made a
child of y and the rank of y is increase by 1.

If either x or y is not present in the input set, nothing is done.
